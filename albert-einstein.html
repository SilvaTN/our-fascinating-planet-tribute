            <figcaption>A photo of Albert Einstein probably holding a piece of chalk, but also possibly a joint - as science is  done most effectively when one is high, in order for one to be able to come up with crazy theories, like X. Science is often done using solely a blackboard, so that scientists can quickly erase a theory if they realise it is silly and feel embarrassed by it. </figcaption>

            Albert Einstein (also known by his stage name, Bert the Destroyer) was a theoretical physicist, which is a physicist who is only theoretically a physicist but not actually one, usually because they are too incompetent to be considered an actual physicist.
            Albert Einstein is one of the biggest names in Science. It has 14 letters, and 15 characters if you include the space between his first name and last name. It falls behind only Neil DeGrass Tyson's name, which has about 17 characters, and is also considered to have a lot of character. Albert Einstein, beyond this, was one of the most influential scientists ever. He influenced others not just with his inventions, but through manipulation as well as inventions that manipulated others, like the Black Gear, inspired by the black gears from the Digimon Adventure manga which was released in the same year he graduated from the theoretical school of science. 
            After inventing e=mc&sup2, he invented the lava lamp and, more importantly, tried to sabotage anyone else's invention that threatened to replace his. His main method of sabotage was by staging breaking-and-enterings in labs that were developing new light technology and then breaking everything inside the building - hence the stage name, "Bert the Destroyer". This is why many households today, especially in the third world and Germany, still operate entirely on lava lamps. It is a wide misconception that lava lamps do <b>not</b> use actual lava - they <b>do</b> use actual lava. This was a lie popularised by the Destroyer himself, in an attempt to minimise fear over his invention and maximise sales of the product.
