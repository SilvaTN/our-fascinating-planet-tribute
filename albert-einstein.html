                A photo of Albert Einstein probably holding a piece of chalk, as science is often written solely on a blackboard, so that scientists can quickly erase a theory if they later realise it is silly and feel embarrassed by it.
                Some theorise, however, that Albert could have possibly been holding a joint because science is done most effectively when one is high (to allow for one to come up with deranged but true theories, like how the Earth is constantly spinning at 1600km/h and yet most of us are not flung out into space by the force of this swiveling - a phenomenon which we now know is caused by the Earth  moving through space at the same velocity that it is flinging us into it, like a yo-yo with a very short string held by a person who is terrified of yo-yos).

            Albert Einstein (also known by his stage name, Bert the Destroyer) was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics" target="_blank">theoretical physicist</a>, which is a non-physicist who aspires to be a real physicist but is not actually one, usually due to incompetence.
            <br>Albert Einstein is one of the biggest names in Science: it has fourteen letters - fifteen characters if you include the space between his first name and last name (it falls behind only Neil DeGrass Tyson's name, which has about seventeen characters, and is also considered to have quite a lot of character). Additionally, Einstein was one of the most influential scientists ever. He influenced others not just with his inventions, but through manipulation.
                <!-- [{REMOVE:  ...through manipulation as well as inventions of manipulation, like the Black Gear, which is an evil device used to control others, inspired by the infamous black gears from the Digimon Adventure manga which was released in the same year Albert graduated from the theoretical school of science.]} -->
            <br>After inventing e=mc&sup2, he invented the famous lava lamp and, more importantly, tried to sabotage anyone else's invention that threatened to replace his. Beyond manipulation, his main method of sabotage was by staging breaking-and-enterings in labs that he believed were developing new light technology, and then breaking everything inside the labs - hence his stage name, "Bert the Destroyer". This is also why many households today still operate entirely on lava lamp technology, and why there isn't as much money in science anymore, because Einstein keeps breaking everything.
                <span class="did-you-know">Did you know?
                <br>It is a wide misconception that lava lamps do <b>not</b> use actual lava - they <b>do</b> use actual lava. This was a lie proliferated by the Destroyer himself, to maximise sales of the product because, as he explained in an interview on his deathbed, "Who would knowingly want lava inside their house and hanging from their ceilings?".</span>
        </p>
        <div>Death and Controversies</div>
        <p>Although Einstein's biological body died in 1955, his "mind" is still active today through technology and faith. On his deathbed, before dying, Einstein requested that a 3D x-ray scan of his brain was made, in order to "preserve his genius eternally". Unfortunately, the x-ray fried his brain to ashes, as well as his entire head and upper neck. Einstein was extremely healthy and doctors believe he would have probably lived for another 20 years if he hadn't x-rayed his head, or at least if he had done a 2D x-ray instead of a full 3D one. Many took comfort in the fact that at least Bert the Destroyer destroyed one last thing as he left the physical realm and went into the next realm where there is nothing physical for him to destroy.
        <br> However, modern technology was able to recreate Albert's mind through computer chips, usb sticks, and other devices with misleading names. Scientists were able to reproduce Albert's mind by scanning the ashes of his brain, this time with modern x-ray equipment, instead of the approach Einstein took, which was to utilise the oldest, most archaic x-ray machine they could find to scan his brain. 
        <br> After scanning the ashes of Einstein's brain, the x-rayologists threw the ashes into the sea, hoping that the salt water might solidify the ashes back into the shape of a brain. They granted this was a long shot, and were not surprised to see that the ashes merely dissolved into the water - however, one of the x-rayologists added that, "maybe if there wasn't so much wind the brain ash all fell together in a pile into the water, instead of half of it flying back into our faces and clothes, then maybe the salt water plan would have worked..." Having had their ideal plan fail, they went back to their more time-consuming backup idea of using technology to generate an A.I that mimicked Einstein's brain. After almost 2 decades of development, the x-rayologists relised they needed experts from other areas helping them in their project. And just 8 months after that, their project was complete: they had successfully recreated Einstein's mind, right down to his desire for manipulation, which they considered a part of his genius.
        </p>
        <p>Today, Einstein's recreated head can be found behind a glass display in the Theoratical Museum of Germany. This has caused 2 controversies due to the fact that the x-rayologists created another sentient being from scratch, which is unethical and therefore unnatural. Another journalist said that, "if we are gonna spend taxpayer money on recreating Albert Einstein's head, we should at least be able to touch it, not just be forced to look at it behind a glass window." Einstein's head, on the other hand, has stated, "Why the hell did they not attach my head to my old body at least?! What was their end goal?!"  </p>
