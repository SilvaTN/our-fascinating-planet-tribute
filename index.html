    <h1>The Planet</h1>
    <p>This is a parody fact/Wikipedia page about planet Earth, according to Fascinating Planet, by Demetri Martin. Things to include in the page includes: how loud the bing bang was, what are black holes, etc. Then post the page on demetri martin reddit or something.</p>
    <p>include a part about gravity and how the earth is like a trampoline [por causa daquela alanogia q scientistas fazem]. This, of course, raises the question, if gravity is like a trampoline, what happens when I get on an actual trampoline? Well, if there were no gravity, then jumping on a trampoline would be like jumping on normal ground. This theory has even been corroborated after astronauts sent a trampoline to the space station, and trampolines have since been used in space when astronauts want to experience normal gravity (say that this is a picture of a trampoline from above https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0094576509005128-gr3.jpg have a caption under the image saying that in space, trampolines are called a homopolar artificial gravity generator.
    Because there are effectively two layers of trampolines, i.e. gravity and the trampoline, we experience what is called a double jump.
    Another question one might have is what happens if we put a trampoline on top of another trampoline while being in a gravity zone. This, of course, means there is 3 times as much gravity acting on a mass. It is sometimes called 3-dimensional graivty. Scientist, and moustache enthusiast, Neil deGrass Tyson, explains that scientists have have only theoried about this, since building such a system would require "too many trampolines", adding, "where do you even get ONE trampoline?" Scientists speculate that jumping on a 3-dimensional gravity mechanism, ie two trampolines on the ground or 3 trampolines in space, would cause one to reach the speed of light before turning into a grape-sized ball and then turning into a black hole, becoming a singularity.</p>
