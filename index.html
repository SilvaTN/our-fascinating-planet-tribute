<!-- Neil deGrass Edison was one of the most influential scientists of the second half of this millenia. He invented the lava lamp and, more importantly, sabotaged anyone else's invention that threatened to replace his. -->

<!-- The word "scientist" comes from the root word sigh. Scientists are called scientists because the majority of them spend most of their time sighing in frustration from not having made any new discoveries or inventions. Those who do discover or invent something, spend the rest of their days sighing in relief. The greater the discovery or invention, the louder and longer the sigh. It is said that when Albert Einstein invented the equation e=mc^2, his sigh, which lasted over 3min, was heard throughout his entire neighbourhood and was so long and loud that it caused some of his neighbours to enter a state of temporary coma, while others went permanently insane, which Einstein called, "a necessary sacrifice for science". One of the surviving neighbours described Einstein's sigh as "loud but also soft", as if he were, "sighing quietly into a massive microphone". Another neighbour said, "it was as if I had a thousand ears and there was someone sighing into each of them at the same time." Eintein's equation, of course revolutionised science because not only did it have only one number, which was unheard of at the time, but also because it proved that letters and numbers could be used together to express confusing ideas.

<!-- at the end, it says "see who is your local scientist" or "contact me". And the contact section pops up a section to check if the user is a robot. The first question is 'are you a robot' and you have to select the correct image from "yes" or "no". And if you press "yes" it says, "that's exactly what a robot would say." The next question is the standard "click on all squares with cars" (this is the only test that actually checks if the person is a robot - all other tests allow for failure). The next test is "throw the ball at the ghost", and the ghost is moving really fast and if you miss the shot, it says, "you failed, which means that you are a robot or you do not know what a ghost is", which is funny because most people would miss because the ghost is moving too fast. Then, it gives you a really hard maths question and you have to get it wrong in order to pass. Then it gives you a trick question, "which is the tastiest brand of oil?" and if shows 3 pictures of metal oil and one of olive oil. Then the last question is "what is love?", and it gives you a textbox to write in and it accepts whatever answer you give.  -->



<!-- in the X, make a link to another html page you created about the local scientist. 
    There will be a map of the world below the title, which is either "Find your representative" or "The Science Representatives of the world". You can click on any part of the map and the page scrolls down to (and highlights for a few seconds) the representative of that region. The map will have a caption, "This is a map of planet Earth portrait in 2d space, even though the earth is actually 3d, to convey that science is confusing."
    There will be 2 sections: America and the rest of the world; under the rest of the world, it will say that people decided to just have "one Neil deGrasse Tyson to rule them all". There will be one representative for each American state, with a photo and a description of the representative. On the top, it will say that the Neil are in order of most important Neil. The last Neil will have the caption that he is the least important Neil and they have done nothing remarkable and that all the other Neils often make fun of of him publicly. Below, in the World Neil, it will say that he is most known for making fun of the least important Neil of America. His most famous line is that "the only knock-knock joke that Neil should tell is the one where Nobody is at the door because that is what he is," also adding that, "It is mind boggling that he was one of the first Neils to come into existence, since he is just a cheap knock-off of the Neil entity and he is a disgrace to the elegant Neil moustache and he should shave it before he ruins moustaches for the rest of us Neils".
Most photos will be of Neil deGrasse Tyson with a couple of albert Einsteins. Make the photos each be a different photo of Neil in different positions to make it clear that each Neil is different. Each Neil will be called Neil deGrass Tyson but they will have in brackets (also known as "[insert name variation, eg Biel jeGrassica Timson]" to avoid confusion). The second representative (from the top) will say something like "This Neil has been elected for the 4th consecutive year and is the scientist and Neil with the most consecutive wins." The third representative will read, "This was the Neil who invented the concept of varying the Neil name, to avoid confusion." Some other descriptions to include:
    Neil likes ice cream and volcanos.
    Neil also likes ice cream and volcanos.
    Neil does NOT like ice nor volcanos.
    This Neil was responsible for popularising science among normal people, through simple-to-understand documentaries, in hopes of increasing scientific advacement. There were no increase in scientific advances and Neil himself said, "I don't know why I thought regular/ordinary people would be able to help." However, making science more accessible to the masses is still widely regarded as a nice thing. However, Neil has dismissed this praise, maintaining that he preferred when people were more ignorant because "that was more funny".
Under an Einstein, have it saying that they are famous for saying, "We should repeat an experiment 1000 times if needed, until we get a different result, then we know we have done science." Einstein was a very controversial candidate, especially since he was dead and responsible for the atomic bomb. Einstein defended saying people "blew" things out of proportions, and that he "was gonna blow them up too if they didn't shut up". Another Einstein will read that he is famous for saying, "if you can't explain it simply, then you are too stupid to do science," where "it" refers to the plot of Harry Potter.
There are is one Neil for every 6 United States states, there are 50 states in total, if you include [option 1: Maine, which many suspect is a ficitonal place that only came to life because Stephen King's stories are so vivid; option 2:, Alaska] plus a quarter of a Neil for [insert state]. This is because there are 18 letters in Neil deGrasse Tyson's name, and 50 / (18 - 10) = 6, 10 is the number of times that [insert]. Scientists decided on this formula to represent how sometimes formulas in science seem unnecessarily confusing.

            <h2>How big are things?</h2>
            <p>The Earth is exactly 12,000.0 kilometres in diameter. We know this because <a href="neil-degrasse-tyson.html" target="_blank">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> told us that. Compare this to the Sun, which is 432,666.26667 miles in radius, meaning you could fit inside the Sun 101.1209 million Earths, assuming the Earths were first cut into wedges to be able to fit inside the Sun, or 138.10588 million Earths, if the Earths were pulverized into a thick liquid mix by an astronomical blender. To convey this in layperson terms, you could fit one million three hundred and one thousand five hundred thirds of the Sun into one Earth.</p>
        </section>


        <section> 
            <h2>432,666.26667: Why does the size of the Sun have so many 6s?</h2>
            <p class="double-col">Historically, western civilisations have maintained that the Sun, having 2 pairs of 666s in its size and being "awfully hot", was made by Satan, and they have tried to blow it up several times. In contrast, most non-western civilisations believe that the Sun is a great, powerful, benevolent entity, and they have also tried to blow it up several times, but as a way of testing if the Sun really is as great and powerful as they thought it was, which they eventually concluded that, yes, it is.<br>

            However, the truth is not a popularity contest where the masses get to decide what the Sun is or isn't. Instead, it is a popularity contest that only scientists get to participate it in. Scientists are elected at their electorate by citizens who vote for their local wanna-be scientist representative in what is called a "Democratic Dictatorship", where the majority of democratically elected scientists get to pick every scientific decision that is made in a country. Previous attempts to make this system fair (to prevent, for example, 51% of voters - who usually only represent 25% of a population - from ruling the 49% of other votes, plus the people who didn't vote, which usually means around 52% of the whole population of a country) have not succeeded. The closest system to replace this democratic dictatorship was an online-Mario-Kart-type system, where each voter voted for a scientist candidate (most of whom are called either Neil deGrasse Tyson or Albert Einstein) by writing their name on a piece of paper and one of these names was then drawn randomly from a giant hat. However, the hat idea came under fire after one of the giant hats caught on fire and burned all the paper strips inside with the votes, which everyone called "a big hassle" and it was decided to just not do elections that year. Additionally, some have even questioned the merits of voting itself, but in the end a Neil deGrasse pointed out that, "Anyone over the age of 18 can vote for whoever they like, so you know you are getting the best possible leader."<br>

            Hence scientists have decided, through their scientific popularity contest, under the Democratic Dictatorship system, that the Sun has absolutely nothing to do with Satan, probably.<br>
            However, although scientists aren't concerned with this religious preoccupation, they <i>have</i> said that they <i>are</i> working on getting the current 432,666.26667km up to a more accurate measure, in hopes of finding at least a few 8s and 1s, and possibly even some 5s, because they "like it when numbers are different".</p>

            <h2>What About Global Warming?</h2>
            <p>The Earth is currently experiencing a rapid increase in temperate, caused by the human species, which scientists estimate will destroy all life on Earth "pretty soon". This, of course, is part of the "End It All" movement started by biophysicist Biel jeGrassica Timson, who pointed out that, "the Earth is a terrible place," and that we should, "destroy it as soon as possible, for God's sake." Since then, all humans across the globe have banded together in an attempt to destroy the Earth as quickly and completely as possible.<br>
            Some have suggested dropping all the atomic bombs we have at once, to just, "end it all right now." However, as biologist and twin, Seal DiZest Twiceson, has pointed out, that would take "too much organisation and synchronicity", which the human species is "notoriously bad at."</p>

            <h2>Gravity</h2>
            <p class="double-col">Many scientists, including astronomer Jupiel deGass TerSun, have said that gravity is like a trampoline, and that, "you can bounce on it, and stuff." This information has been corroborate by this <a href="https://youtu.be/cHySqQtb-rk?t=29" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> which has a decent amount of likes. In the video, we see that planet Earth just bounces around in space, and each bounce corresponds to a season, contrary to the outdated idea that the Earth orbits the Sun by just sliding across space, like an oily bowling ball on a slippery wood floor. Additionally, this discovery about gravity being a giant trampoline has led to another discovery that there are, in fact, 6 seasons, and that they always start with a capital letter. The Northern Hemisphere experiences Summer followed by another Summer, then it's Autumn, another Autumn, then Winter, then Spring. The opposite happens in the Southern Hemisphere. Some places don't experience all the 6 seasons. The Middle and Side Hemispheres experience two Summers back to back, but only one Autumn, although this Autumn is extra-long, lasting the equivalent of two regular Autumns. Astrobotanist, Peel deGrass Thymeson  has argued that this new theory of the seasons is only syntactically different to the previous one and that we should go back to having 4 seasons, also adding that, otherwise, Vivaldi's song "just wouldn't make sense."<br> 

            This "Trampoline Gravity" theory of course raises the question, if gravity is like a trampoline, what happens when I get on an actual trampoline? On Earth, we experience what scientists call a "bounce", which is when one jumps higher than ones does when one is not on a trampoline. Additionally, we know that if we were in outer space or the other space, otter space, which is a space inhabited by otters, then jumping on a trampoline would be like jumping on normal ground on Earth. This knowledge was corroborated when Russian astronauts mistakenly sent a trampoline to NASA's International Space Station instead of their own inferior low-budget station. The American astronauts found that they experienced gravity on the trampoline. They were so amazed at the discovery that not only did they keep the misdelivered trampoline, but they also took credit for the discovery. Trampolines have since been used in space when astronauts want to experience normal Earth gravity.</p>

            </figure>
            

            <p>Another question one might have is what happens if we put a trampoline on top of another. This, of course, means there is 3 times as much gravity acting on a mass, also known as 3-dimensional gravity. Astrophysicist and moustache enthusiast, Neil deGrasse Tyson, explained that scientists have only theorised about this, as building such a system would require "too many trampolines", adding, "I don't even have ONE trampoline. Who has TWO?" Scientists speculate that jumping on a 3-dimensional gravity mechanism, ie two trampolines on the ground or 3 trampolines in space, would cause one to reach the speed of light, before turning into a grape-sized ball, then becoming a singularity and forming a black hole.</p>

            <h2>Why Are They Called "Scientists"? (it sounds silly)</h2>
            <p>The word "scientist" comes from the root word "sigh". Scientists are called scientists because the majority of them spend most of their time sighing in frustration from not having made any new discoveries or inventions. Those who do discover or invent something, spend the rest of their days sighing in relief - the greater the invention, the greater the sigh. It is said that when <a href="albert-einstein.html" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a> invented the equation e=mc&sup2, his sigh, which lasted over 45 seconds, was heard throughout his entire neighbourhood and was so long and loud that it caused some of his neighbours to enter a state of temporary coma, while others went permanently insane, which Einstein called, "a necessary sacrifice for science". One of the surviving neighbours described Einstein's sigh as "loud but also soft", as if he were, "sighing quietly into a gigantic microphone". Another neighbour said, "it was as if I had 1000 ears and there were 1000 people sighing into each of them at the same time." Eintein's equation, of course revolutionised science because not only did it have only one number, which was unheard of at the time, but also because it proved that letters and numbers could be used together to express confusing ideas.
