        <p id="tribute-info">This page is dedicated to providing the most accurate information about the amazing, but mostly just straight-up confusing world we find ourselves in: planet Earth - and also the rest of the universe. To find more information about earth, you can visit <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

        <h2>How big is the Earth?</h2>
        <p>The Earth is exactly 12,000.0 kilometres in diameter. Compare this to the Sun, which is 432,666.26667 miles in radius, meaning you could fit inside the sun 101.1209 million Earths (assuming the Earths were first cut into wedges) or 138.10588 million Earths (if the earths were pulverized into a thick liquid mix by an astronomical blender). To convey this in layperson terms, you could fit one million three hundred and one thousand five hundred thirds of the sun into the Earth.</p>

        <h2>432,666.26667: Why does the size of the sun have so many 6s?</h2>
        <p>Historically, western civilisations have argued that the Sun, having 2 pairs of 666s in its size, and being "awfully hot", is made by Satan, and they have tried to blow it up several times. Most non-western civilisations believe that the sun is a great and benevolent entity, and have also tried to blow it up several, but as a way of testing if the sun really is as great as they thought it was, which they eventually concluded that, yes, it is.<br>
        However, the truth is not a popularity contest where the average person..., instead, it is a popularity contest that only scientists get to participate it in. Of course, scientists <i>are</i> elected at their local electorate by citizens who vote for their local scienstist representative in what is called a "Democratic Dictatorship", where the majority of voters get to pick every scientific decision that is made in a country. Previous attempts to make this system fair (and prevent, say, 51% of voters (who usually only represent 25% of a population) from ruling the 49% of other votes, plus the people who didn't vote, which usually means around 52% of the population of a coutry), have not suceeded. The closest system was online-Mario-Kart-type system, where voters vote for a scientist (most of whom are called Neil DeGrass Tyson) and the name is drawn from a hat. However, the hat idea came under fire after a hat caught on fire and burned all the paper strips inside with the votes, which everyone called "a big hassle" and decided to just not do elections that year. Some have even questioned the merits of voting itself, but in the end it was pointed out that, "Anyone in the over the age of 18 can vote for whoever they like, so you know you are getting the best possible leader."<br>
        Hence scientists have decided, through their popularity contest, under the Democratic Dictatorship system, that the sun has absolutely nothing to do with Satan, probably.<br>
        Although scientists don't agree with the worry of the general western populations, they <i>are</i> working on getting a more accurate measure of the sun's radius, in hopes of finding at least a few 8s and 1s, and possibly even some 5s, because they "like it when numbers have more variation".</p>

        <h2>What About Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>The Earth is currently experience human-made temperature increase, which scientists estimate will destroy all life on Earth "pretty soon". This, of course, is part of the "End It" movement started by astrophysicist Smneil Th'Grass Tie-Sun, who pointed out that, "the earth is a terrible place," and that we should, "destroy it as soon as possible, for God's sake." Since then, all humans across the Earth have banded together in an attempt to destroy the Earth as quickly and completely as possible.<br>
        Some have suggested dropping all the atomic bombs we have at once, to just, "end it all right now." However, as biologist Peel DaZest Apple-pie'son have pointed out, that would take "too much organisation and synchronisity", which the human species is "notoriously incapable of."</p>

        <h2>Gravity</h2>
        <p>include a part about gravity and how the earth is like a trampoline [por causa daquela alanogia q scientistas fazem]. This, of course, raises the question, if gravity is like a trampoline, what happens when I get on an actual trampoline? Well, if there were no gravity, then jumping on a trampoline would be like jumping on normal ground. This theory has even been corroborated after astronauts sent a trampoline to the space station, and trampolines have since been used in space when astronauts want to experience normal gravity (say that this is a picture of a trampoline from above https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0094576509005128-gr3.jpg have a caption under the image saying that in space, trampolines are called a homopolar artificial gravity generator.
        Because there are effectively two layers of trampolines, i.e. gravity and the trampoline, we experience what is called a double jump.
        Another question one might have is what happens if we put a trampoline on top of another trampoline while being in a gravity zone. This, of course, means there is 3 times as much gravity acting on a mass. It is sometimes called 3-dimensional graivty. Scientist, and moustache enthusiast, Neil deGrass Tyson, explains that scientists have have only theoried about this, since building such a system would require "too many trampolines", adding, "I don't even have ONE trampoline. Who has TWO?!" Scientists speculate that jumping on a 3-dimensional gravity mechanism, ie two trampolines on the ground or 3 trampolines in space, would cause one to reach the speed of light before turning into a grape-sized ball and then turning into a black hole, becoming a singularity.</p>
