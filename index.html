        <p id="tribute-info">This page is dedicated to providing the most accurate information about the amazing, but mostly just straight-up confusing world we find ourselves in: planet Earth - and also the rest of the universe. To find more information about earth, you can visit <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

        <h2>How big is the Earth</h2>
        <p>The Earth is 12742 kilometres in diameter. Compare this to the Sun, which is 432,690 miles in radius, meaning you could fit inside the sun 101.1209 million Earths (assuming the Earths were first cup into wedges) or 138.10588 million Earths (if the earths were pulverized into a thick liquid mix by an astronomical blender). To convey the size of the earth layman terms, you could fit one million three hundred and one thousand five hundred thirds of the sun into the Earth.</p>

    <h1>The Planet</h1>
    <p>This is a parody fact/Wikipedia page about planet Earth, according to Fascinating Planet, by Demetri Martin. Things to include in the page includes: how loud the bing bang was, what are black holes, etc. Then post the page on demetri martin reddit or something.</p>
    <h2>Gravity</h2>
    <p>include a part about gravity and how the earth is like a trampoline [por causa daquela alanogia q scientistas fazem]. This, of course, raises the question, if gravity is like a trampoline, what happens when I get on an actual trampoline? Well, if there were no gravity, then jumping on a trampoline would be like jumping on normal ground. This theory has even been corroborated after astronauts sent a trampoline to the space station, and trampolines have since been used in space when astronauts want to experience normal gravity (say that this is a picture of a trampoline from above https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0094576509005128-gr3.jpg have a caption under the image saying that in space, trampolines are called a homopolar artificial gravity generator.
    Because there are effectively two layers of trampolines, i.e. gravity and the trampoline, we experience what is called a double jump.
    Another question one might have is what happens if we put a trampoline on top of another trampoline while being in a gravity zone. This, of course, means there is 3 times as much gravity acting on a mass. It is sometimes called 3-dimensional graivty. Scientist, and moustache enthusiast, Neil deGrass Tyson, explains that scientists have have only theoried about this, since building such a system would require "too many trampolines", adding, "where do you even get ONE trampoline?" Scientists speculate that jumping on a 3-dimensional gravity mechanism, ie two trampolines on the ground or 3 trampolines in space, would cause one to reach the speed of light before turning into a grape-sized ball and then turning into a black hole, becoming a singularity.</p>
