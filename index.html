        <p id="tribute-info">This page is dedicated to providing the most accurate information about the amazing, but mostly just straight-up confusing world we find ourselves in: planet Earth - and also the rest of the universe. To find more information about Earth, you can visit <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

        <h2>How big are things?</h2>
        <p>The Earth is exactly 12,000.0 kilometres in diameter. We know this because Neil deGrasse Tyson told us that. Compare this to the Sun, which is 432,666.26667 miles in radius, meaning you could fit inside the Sun 101.1209 million Earths, assuming the Earths were first cut into wedges to be able to fit inside the Sun, or 138.10588 million Earths, if the Earths were pulverized into a thick liquid mix by an astronomical blender. To convey this in layperson terms, you could fit one million three hundred and one thousand five hundred thirds of the Sun into one Earth.</p>


        <h2>432,666.26667: Why does the size of the Sun have so many 6s?</h2>
        <p>Historically, western civilisations have argued that the Sun, having 2 pairs of 666s in its size and being "awfully hot", was made by Satan, and they have tried to blow it up several times. In contrast, most non-western civilisations believe that the Sun is a great, powerful, benevolent entity, and they have also tried to blow it up several times, but as a way of testing if the Sun really is as great and powerful as they thought it was, which they eventually concluded that, yes, it is.<br>

        However, the truth is not a popularity contest where the masses get to decide what the Sun is or isn't.Instead, it is a popularity contest that only scientists get to participate it in. Scientists are elected at their electorate by citizens who vote for their local wanna-be scienstist representative in what is called a "Democratic Dictatorship", where the majority of democratically elected scientists get to pick every scientific decision that is made in a country. Previous attempts to make this system fair (to prevent, for example, 51% of voters - who usually only represent 25% of a population - from ruling the 49% of other votes, plus the people who didn't vote, which usually means around 52% of the whole population of a coutry) have not suceeded. The closest system to replace this democratic dictatorship was an online-Mario-Kart-type system, where each voter voted for a scientist candidate (most of whom are called either Neil deGrasse Tyson or Albert Einstein) by writing their name on a piece of paper and one of these names were then drawn randomnly from a giant hat. However, the hat idea came under fire after one of the giant hats caught on fire and burned all the paper strips inside with the votes, which everyone called "a big hassle" and it was decided to just not do elections that year. Additionally, some have even questioned the merits of voting itself, but in the end it was pointed out that, "Anyone over the age of 18 can vote for whoever they like, so you know you are getting the best possible leader."<br>

        Hence scientists have decided, through their scientific popularity contest, under the Democratic Dictatorship system, that the Sun has absolutely nothing to do with Satan, probably.<br>
        However, although scientists don't agree with this religious worry, they <i>have</i> said that they <i>are</i> working on getting the current 432,666.26667km up to a more accurate measure, in hopes of finding at least a few 8s and 1s, and possibly even some 5s, because they "like it when numbers are different".</p>

        <h2>What About Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>The Earth is currently experiencing a rapid increase in temperate, caused by the human species, which scientists estimate will destroy all life on Earth "pretty soon". This, of course, is part of the "End It All" movement started by biophysicist Biel jeGrassica Timson, who pointed out that, "the Earth is a terrible place," and that we should, "destroy it as soon as possible, for God's sake." Since then, all humans across the globe have banded together in an attempt to destroy the Earth as quickly and completely as possible.<br>
        Some have suggested dropping all the atomic bombs we have at once, to just, "end it all right now." However, as biologist and twin, Seal DiZest Twiceson, have pointed out, that would take "too much organisation and synchronisity", which the human species is "notoriously bad at."</p>

        <h2>Gravity</h2>
        <p>Many scientists, including astronomer Jupiel deGass TerSun, have said that graivity is like a trampoline, and that, "you can bounce on it, and stuff." This information has been corroborate by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHySqQtb-rk" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> which has a decent amount of likes. In the video, we see that planet Earth just bounces around in space, and each bounce corresponds to a season, contrary to the outdated idea that the Earth orbits the Sun by just sliding across space, like an oily bowling ball on a slippery surface. Additionally, this discovery about gravity being a giant trampoline has led to another discovery that there are, in fact, 6 seasons, and that they always start with a capital letter. The Northen Hemisphere experiences Summer followed by another Summer, then it's Autumn, another Autumn, then Winter, then Spring. The opposite happens in the Sourthern Hemisphere. Some places don't experience all the 6 seasons. The Middle and Side Hemispheres experience two Summers back to back, but only one Autumn, although this Autumn is extra long, lasting the equivalent of two regular Autumns. Astrobotanist, Peel deGrass Thymeson  has argued that this new theory of the seasons is only semantically different to the previous one and that we should go back to having 4 seasons, also adding that, otherwise, Vivaldi's song "just wouldn't make sense."<br> 

        This "Trampoline Gravity" theory of course raises the question, if gravity is like a trampoline, what happens when I get on an actual trampoline? On Earth, we experience what scientists call a "bounce", which is when one jumps higher than ones does when one is not on a trampoline. Additionally, we know that if we were in outer space or the other space, otter space, which is a space inhibited by otters, then jumping on a trampoline would be like jumping on normal ground on Earth. This knowledge was corroborated when Russian astronauts mistakenly sent a trampoline to NASA's International Space Station instead of their own inferior low-budget station. The American astronauts found that they experienced gravity on the trampoline. They were so amazed at the discovery that not only did they keep the misdelivered trampoline, but they also took credit for the discovery. Trampolines have since been used in space when astronauts want to experience normal Earth gravity. Below is a diagram of a modern space trampoline, also called a homopolar artificial gravity generator.</p>

        <p>Another question one might have is what happens if we put a trampoline on top of another trampoline on Earth. This, of course, means there is 3 times as much gravity acting on a mass. It is sometimes called 3-dimensional graivty. Scientist, and moustache enthusiast, Neil deGrasse Tyson, explains that scientists have have only theoried about this, since building such a system would require "too many trampolines", adding, "I don't even have ONE trampoline. Who has TWO?!" Scientists speculate that jumping on a 3-dimensional gravity mechanism, ie two trampolines on the ground or 3 trampolines in space, would cause one to reach the speed of light before turning into a grape-sized ball and then turning into a black hole, becoming a singularity.</p>
